   * |black|_
   * |flake8|_
   * |isort|_
* |pyenv|_ / |pyenv-virtualenv|_ are great and highly recommended but not covered in
  this guide

.. code-block:: console

    $ git clone https://github.com/robinhood-unofficial/pyrh.git
    $ cd Robinhood
    $ brew install poetry
    $ brew install pre-commit

Lint checks are automatically run when you try to push the code. To manually run them
run the following command. If you want to skip the lint check, you can do that by using
`--no-verify` when committing.

.. code-block:: console

    (pyrh_env) $ pre-commit run -a
    (pyrh_env) $ git commit -am "Some patch commit" --no-verify # will skip lint checks

Running tests and viewing coverage

.. code-block:: console

    (pyrh_env) $ pytest # from the root directory
    (pyrh_env) $ open htmlcov/index.html # opens coverage in browser (on macOS)

sure to go to GitHub fork the project and switch your remotes. Please try to update the
docs and write some initial tests to aid with code review. Once you're all set please
add a towncrier_ file of your changes to the newsfragment directory.
