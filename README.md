# API Design & Implementation  Final Project

## Introduction
There are many public APIs with flawed functionality. This could range from broken methods
to simply poor documentation. Our task for this assignment was to find a broken public API and redesign it. The public
 API chosen for this assignment was 'pyrh' (https://pyrh.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), with the following description
 "Python Framework to make trades with Unofficial Robinhood API. Supports Python 3.6+."  

## Pyrh Redesign
Although Pyrh does allow Robinhood users to trade using the API, there were many flaws found including:
* API Organization
* Broken Methods
* Poor Documentation
* Incorrect Return Types

Our redesign of the API resolves the issues listed above while providing users with a more intuitive design for trading. The full documentation for our redesign can be found here: https://pyrh-redesign.readthedocs.io/en/latest/
